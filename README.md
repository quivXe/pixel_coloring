# pixel_coloring
Hey!
Here you have a mini-game, where you can color pixel by pixel (with size you want) any picture you want.

![alt text](https://github.com/quivXe/example_images/blob/main/example.png?raw=True)

My plans:
- remake all game and base on something else cuz this can make computer cry
- make full GUI instead of working in terminal
- make game much prettier cuz it looks ugly
- change resolution of canvas if image is small
- add a zoom option

Write if you have idea!
