# pixel_coloring
Hey!
Here you have a mini-game, where you can color pixel by pixel (with size you want) any picture you want.

![alt text](https://github.com/quivXe/example_images/blob/main/example.png?raw=True)

How to play:
- first just download png or jpg image and put it to folder
- enter how many colors you want in iamge and size of one pixel
- then program convert image to pixels
- then just choose color and color your image pixel by pixel

How it works:
- program makes the photo less color (1-9 colors depends on user input)
- then just divides into pixel of chosen size and unluckly at the moment every pixel is in list

My plans:
- remake all game and base on something else cuz this can make computer cry
- make full GUI instead of working in terminal
- make game much prettier cuz it looks ugly
- change resolution of canvas if image is small
- add a zoom option

Write if you have idea!
